## 📖 Overview

This repository presents a carefully structured reading path through 13 landmark papers that tell the story of modern deep learning. Starting with Generative Adversarial Networks and culminating in efficient Retrieval-Augmented Generation systems, this collection shows how each breakthrough built upon the previous one to shape today's AI landscape.

## 🎯 Why This Sequence?

Rather than presenting papers chronologically or by topic in isolation, this collection follows the **conceptual evolution** of ideas:

- **Generative foundations** → How neural networks learned to create
- **Attention mechanisms** → The architectural breakthrough that changed everything
- **Scale and pretraining** → Making models smarter through more data and compute
- **Cross-domain unification** → Extending transformers beyond text
- **Efficiency innovations** → Making powerful models practical
- **Knowledge augmentation** → Combining reasoning with retrieval
